# Piano Keyboard Visualization - Quick Start

## What Changed?

Your note display has been completely redesigned! Instead of showing notes in a vertical list or spectrum bars, detected notes now appear on a **full piano keyboard** that spans from C0 to C8 (63 white keys).

## How It Looks

When you detect notes, each note will:
1. Be shown on its exact piano key
2. Have a colored confidence bar filling the key
3. Show the confidence percentage on the key
4. Use consistent colors for confidence levels

## Color Meanings

| Color | Confidence | Meaning |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | â‰¥80% | Very confident detection |
| ðŸŸ¡ Yellow | 60-79% | Good confidence |
| ðŸ”µ Blue/Cyan | 50-59% | Borderline (minimum threshold) |
| âš« Gray | <50% | Below threshold |

## Running the Updated GUI

```powershell
cd 'c:\Users\manua\CodeProjects\other\diapazon\recognotes-desktop-gui'
.\target\release\recognotes-desktop-gui.exe
```

## What to Expect

1. **At rest (no recording)**: 
   - You'll see instructions: "Click 'Start Continuous Recording' to begin"
   - The piano keyboard is not visible yet

2. **While recording**:
   - Click "ðŸŽ¤ Start Continuous Recording"
   - The piano keyboard appears showing all notes C0-C8
   - When notes are detected, they light up on the keyboard
   - Each note shows a color bar indicating confidence

3. **Summary line**:
   - Just below the title, you'll see detected notes in compact format
   - Example: `ðŸŽµ Detected: C4 (85%) | G#6 (54%) | E5 (72%)`

## Code Changes

### Files Modified

1. **`src/visualization.rs`**
   - `draw_note_visualization()` - New piano keyboard implementation (9 octaves, all white keys)
   - Includes HashMap for fast note lookup
   - Renders confidence bars and labels on each key

2. **`src/ui.rs`**
   - Removed verbose note listing
   - Added compact summary line showing detected notes
   - Changed visualization call from spectrum to piano keyboard

### Key Improvements

âœ… Full piano range visible at once
âœ… Intuitive for musicians
âœ… Professional appearance  
âœ… Clear confidence visualization
âœ… Consistent with music theory (octaves, note names)
âœ… No flashing or background changes

## Example Session

```
1. Open GUI
2. Click "Start Continuous Recording"
3. Play a G at the same time for ~1 second
4. You'll see:
   - Summary: "ðŸŽµ Detected: G4 (75%)"
   - Piano keyboard shows key G4 highlighted with yellow bar
   - Key displays "75%" confidence above the bar
5. Continue playing different notes to see them light up
```

## Notes for Testing

- The piano shows **white keys only** for clarity (63 notes total)
- Notes remain visible for at least 1 second (fixed in previous update)
- Confidence bars scale from 0-100% of key height
- The piano keyboard is always visible when recording/detecting
- Placeholder text only shows when idle (not recording and no notes detected)

**Ready to test!** Just run the binary and start recording. ðŸŽµ
