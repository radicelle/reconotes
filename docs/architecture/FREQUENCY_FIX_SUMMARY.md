# Backend Frequency Detection Fix - Summary

## Problem Found
The backend was rejecting valid frequencies that were slightly off-frequency (±5 Hz) due to an issue with how confidence was calculated.

## Root Cause
The original code was averaging **power-based confidence** (from FFT peak strength) with **frequency-match confidence** (from how close the detected frequency was to a note). 

When a frequency didn't perfectly align with an FFT bin:
- The peak would spread across multiple bins, reducing peak power
- Power-based confidence would drop artificially low
- This dragged down the final confidence below the 0.5 threshold, causing valid notes to be rejected

## Solution Applied
Changed the confidence calculation to use **only frequency-match confidence**, ignoring the power-based confidence:

**Before:**
```rust
let final_confidence = (*power_confidence + note_confidence) / 2.0;
```

**After:**
```rust
let final_confidence = note_confidence;  // Frequency-match confidence only
```

## Why This Works
- **Frequency-match confidence** is more reliable because it's based on musical theory (cents difference)
- **Power-based confidence** varies based on FFT bin alignment, not whether a note is actually being sung
- We still filter out noise through the peak detection algorithm (only considers peaks above 35% of max power)

## Test Results

### Comprehensive Note Test: ✅ 33/33 (100%)
All natural notes C2-G6 detected correctly:
- C2: 84% → G6: 99%
- All octaves covered
- All voice types supported

### Frequency Variation Test
The backend now correctly:
- Rejects frequencies that fall between notes (e.g., 420 Hz between G4 and A4)
- Detects notes with some tolerance (e.g., ±10 Hz gets ~60% confidence)
- Only returns high-confidence detections for actual notes in the lookup table

## Backend Configuration
- **Supported Notes**: C2 (65.41 Hz) to G6 (1567.98 Hz)
- **Note Types**: Natural notes only (C, D, E, F, G, A, B) - no sharps/flats
- **Confidence Threshold**: > 0.5 (50%)
- **Voice Types Covered**: Bass, Baritone, Tenor, Countertenor, Contralto, Mezzo-Soprano, Soprano

## Files Modified
- `src/audio_analyzer.rs`:
  - `analyze_chunk_multi()`: Now uses frequency-match confidence only
  - `analyze_chunk()`: Now uses frequency-match confidence only
  - `find_all_peaks()`: Added debug logging for peak detection
