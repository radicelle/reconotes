# Quick Reference Card

## 🚀 Quick Start

```powershell
# Terminal 1: Build & Run Backend
cd recognotes-rust-backend
cargo build --release
$env:RUST_LOG = "info"
.\target\release\recognotes-rust-backend.exe

# Terminal 2: Run Test
cd ..
python .\timing_test.py
```

## 📊 What's Been Fixed

| Issue | Status | How Fixed |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Only 1 note displayed | ✅ FIXED | Changed to show all notes per response |
| Timing out of sync | 🚀 OPTIMIZED | Added Base64 format (50-90% faster expected) |
| Ghost notes in silence | ✅ FIXED | Added 50% confidence filter |
| Unknown bottleneck | 📊 IDENTIFIED | Added detailed timing logs everywhere |

## 📈 Expected Improvements

**If hypothesis correct** (JSON parsing is bottleneck):
- Array format: ~2000ms → Base64 format: ~150ms
- Improvement: 93% faster! 🎉

**If hypothesis wrong** (some other layer):
- Logs will show exactly where time is spent
- Can then apply targeted fix

## 🔍 Key Files

### To Build
- `recognotes-rust-backend/` - FFT analysis engine
- `recognotes-desktop-gui/` - UI application

### To Test
- `timing_test.py` - Compare array vs base64 performance
- `stress_test_backend.py` - Concurrent load testing

### To Understand
- `TEST_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Step-by-step guide
- `LOG_ANALYSIS_GUIDE.md` - How to read the logs
- `OPTIMIZATION_SUMMARY.md` - Technical details
- `LATENCY_INVESTIGATION.md` - Investigation methodology

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Latency Goal
- ❌ Before: ~2000ms per request
- ✅ Goal: <200ms per request (10x improvement)
- 🎯 Expected with base64: ~100-150ms

### Detection Accuracy
- ✅ Shows all detected notes (not just latest)
- ✅ No false positives in silence (50% confidence gate)
- ✅ Confidence scores accurate

### Scalability
- ✅ No throttling on 50 concurrent requests
- ✅ Consistent response times (std dev < 50ms)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Build fails | Delete `target/` folder, run `cargo build --release` again |
| Backend won't connect | Check port 5000 not in use: `netstat -ano \| findstr :5000` |
| No timing logs | Set `$env:RUST_LOG = "info"` before running backend |
| Test hangs | Make sure backend is running in another terminal |

## 📝 Log Pattern Cheat Sheet

### Normal Request (Fast)
```
REQUEST: bytes=960, analysis=6ms, convert=25us, serialize=11ms, TOTAL=52ms, notes=1
```
✅ This is good! Total ≈ sum of parts

### Slow Request (Array Format)
```
REQUEST: bytes=960, analysis=6ms, convert=25us, serialize=11ms, TOTAL=2045ms, notes=1
```
❌ Problem! Total >> sum. JSON parsing is bottleneck

### Slow Request (Base64)
```
REQUEST: bytes=960, analysis=6ms, convert=25us, serialize=11ms, TOTAL=45ms, notes=1
```
✅ Good! Base64 fixed it. Hypothesis was correct!

## 🎓 The Hypothesis in One Sentence

> Sending 10ms audio as 960 JSON integers creates ~3KB payload that takes ~2 seconds to parse. Switching to Base64 encoding reduces payload to ~1.2KB and should take <200ms.

## 💡 Remember

1. **The fix is dual-format** - Both old (array) and new (base64) work
2. **Backward compatible** - Doesn't break existing clients
3. **Testable** - timing_test.py proves it works (or doesn't)
4. **Detailed logs** - Will show exactly where time is spent
5. **Low risk** - Just adds new code path, doesn't change existing logic

## 🚀 Next Actions

1. Build both binaries
2. Run backend with logging enabled
3. Run timing_test.py
4. Check if base64 is faster
5. If yes: Deploy optimized binaries!
6. If no: Look at logs to find actual bottleneck

**Status**: Ready for testing! ✨
